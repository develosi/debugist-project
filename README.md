# Debugist Project

The Debugist App is a simple task manager tool specifically designed for the management of debugging and testing your apps and websites. 

It can be hard to keep track of what testing needs to be done for each project build and also what specific tests need to be carried per code base or package used. 

With Debugist each project can be set up by an “admin” user and then multiple members of a team can log in and add or delete certain debugging and testing tasks when required. 

Having wanting to keep track of all the testing requirements for my own projects, I thought creating a debugging and testing task manager tool would be beneficial for myself and for others. 

At present the app is set up as a proof of concept to allow an admin user to be able to log in to create and delete projects, while normal users can log in and create or delete tasks to be completed for those projects. 

Admin log in details are: 

Username: admin

Password: 12345 

Anyone can create a normal user account by registering a username and password, both of which need to be at least five characters long. 

In its current form the app is just a proof of concept with many features missing that I would like to add. I have detailed out these possible future features later on in this README file. Debugist was created as my third milestone project for the Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.
