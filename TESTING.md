Testing was ongoing throughout the build. I utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

I used the console in the developer tools to work through sections of code and ensure that it was working correctly, and also troubleshoot where needed.

I have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.
